        <p> Welcome to the world of online gas booking:<br/>  
            Life is a bouquet of cherished moments and treasured memories which stay with us forever. These are also the moments that give us true happiness.
            
            Happiness is the fragrance that emanates from the wet earth on the onset of rains. Happiness is the blooming of flowers, the return of foliage, the change in weather and the rush of the wind.
            
            It is in the joy of a mother seeing her child finishing the meals, in the pride of a father on return of his daughter after graduating and in the pleasure of driving with friends to explore new destinations.
            
            Over the years, we at HPCL, have strived to be an integral part of these moments.
            
            Best journeys have no destinations, only milestones. The only thing that is more joyful than being happy is the ability to make others happy along the way. As you cover more milestones on your journey, we promise to keep Delivering Happiness.</p>
